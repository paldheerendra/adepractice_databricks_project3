# adepractice_databricks insurance project. Data transformation is being done in medallion architecture databricks

Built the 3 layered (Bronze/Silver/Gold) architecture.
Data contains lot of inconsistency and needs some cleaning.
Once cleanup done, multiple transformation is required.
Final layer i.e. the gold layer will be stored as Data lakehouse in Databricks.
Later on this gold layer data will be accessed by PowerBI for visualization and reporting purpose.
